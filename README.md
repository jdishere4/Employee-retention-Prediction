# Employee Retention Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to identify key factors that influence employee turnover and to build a predictive model that helps HR teams take proactive retention measures.

## Objective
- Analyze employee data to understand attrition patterns
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict employee attrition
- Provide actionable business insights for HR decision-making

## Dataset
- Source: Institutional project dataset
- Type: HR / Employee Attrition Data
- File: employee_attrition_raw.csv

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Joblib

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering and preprocessing pipelines  
4. Model training and evaluation  

## Key Insights
- Employee experience, company size, and training hours play a major role in attrition
- Employees with fewer training opportunities showed higher churn
- Predictive models can help HR teams identify high-risk employees early
